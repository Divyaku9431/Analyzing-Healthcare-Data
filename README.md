**1. Project Title / Headline**

🏥 Divya Healthcare Insights: Hospital LOS & Cost Analytics Dashboard

An interactive Power BI solution to analyze patient discharge trends, average Length of Stay (LOS), and cost efficiency across hospitals and health service areas.

**2. Short Description / Purpose**

This dashboard enables healthcare administrators and analysts to monitor key hospital metrics—such as average LOS days, total discharges, and cost per discharge—across different facilities. It helps identify high-cost or high-risk hospitals and uncover factors influencing healthcare performance using data-driven visuals.

**3. Tech Stack**

The dashboard was built using the following tools and technologies:

• 📊 Power BI Desktop – Main data visualization platform used for report creation.

• 🧠 DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) – Used for calculated measures, dynamic visuals, and conditional logic.

• 📂 Power Query – Data transformation and cleaning layer for reshaping and preparing the data.

• 📝 Data Modeling – Relationships established among tables.

• 📁 File Format – .pbix for development and .png for dashboard previews.

**4. Data Source**

Source: U.S. Healthcare Hospital Discharge & Cost Data
Includes patient discharge records, LOS days, cost per discharge, severity of illness, and hospital profiles across 23 hospitals in the Hudson Valley region.

**5. Features / Highlights**

**Walkthrough of Key Visuals**

• KPI Cards: Track total hospitals, surgeons, discharges, average LOS, and average cost per discharge.

• LOS & Cost Comparison Tabs: Visualize differences in LOS and cost across hospitals with dynamic charts.

• Top & Bottom Facilities: Quickly identify the top 3 and bottom 3 hospitals based on LOS and cost metrics.

• Bubble Scatter Chart: Compare hospitals based on LOS and cost performance using an intuitive XY plot.

• Hospital Profile View: Deep dive into individual hospital performance, patient risk categories, diagnosis type, and discharge status.

• Key Influencers Panel: Auto-analyzes what factors (e.g., severity, mortality risk) increase LOS or costs.

• Slicers for Custom View: Interact with data by selecting health service areas or hospital names.

**Business Impact & Insights**

• Helps healthcare systems identify outliers in cost and LOS to improve efficiency.

• Supports hospital benchmarking for operational performance and patient care.

• Aids in policy-making by highlighting how severity and risk influence patient outcomes.

• Improves transparency in hospital operations and supports data-driven health management decisions.
